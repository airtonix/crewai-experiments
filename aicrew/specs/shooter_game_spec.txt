The game we are going to build is a shoot 'em up game. In this game, the player can shoot projectiles at enemies and move around the screen.
The enemies will appear at a reasonable pace, gradually increasing over time to make the game more challenging.
If the player successfully shoots an enemy, the enemy will get destroyed. However, if the player gets hit by an enemy, it's game over!

The player will control a character on the screen, which can be moved using the arrow keys or any other specified controls.
The character will be equipped with a gun and projectiles that can be fired using a designated button.
To score points, the player must aim and hit the enemies accurately.
